Asthma & COPD Weather Application
Project Overview
The Asthma & COPD Weather Application aims to provide users with information about how weather conditions can impact asthma and COPD, along with practical advice for managing these conditions in different weather scenarios. The current phase of the project focuses on developing a user-friendly web interface to deliver this information effectively.

Page Descriptions
Homepage
Conceptual Aspect: The homepage introduces users to the purpose of the application and encourages exploration of weather-related information for asthma and COPD.
Technical Aspect: Utilizes Bootstrap for responsive design and navigation, along with custom JavaScript to enable user interaction.
About Page
Conceptual Aspect: The About page provides detailed information about the project's objectives, including insights into the impact of weather conditions on asthma and COPD.
Technical Aspect: Includes informative content and a table outlining various weather conditions and their effects on asthma and COPD.
Research Summary
Website Research
Chest Foundation: Provides comprehensive information on asthma, including triggers and management strategies.
Allergy & Asthma Network: Offers insights into asthma symptoms and triggers, helping users understand their condition better.
Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA): Focuses on weather triggers for asthma and provides tips for managing symptoms.

GitHub Repository Research
Repository 1: Offers code snippets for implementing weather APIs, potentially useful for integrating weather data into the application.
Repository 2: Provides structural ideas and possibly reusable components for enhancing the application's UI/UX.
Future Enhancements
Interactive Weather Integration: Integrate a weather API to provide real-time weather data tailored to the user's location.
User Accounts: Implement user accounts to allow users to save preferences and receive personalized recommendations.
Interactive Maps: Incorporate interactive maps to visualize weather patterns and highlight areas with favorable conditions for asthma and COPD.
Reflection on Resources
Generative AI has been instrumental in generating project ideas and guiding the development process. While it provided valuable prompts for designing the application's structure, additional research and learning were necessary to implement specific features effectively.

Website research helped gain insights into asthma and COPD management, guiding content creation for the application. GitHub repositories offered useful code snippets and structural inspiration, enhancing the project's development.

Challenges included ensuring accurate and up-to-date information, as well as balancing design aesthetics with functionality. Preferred sources included reputable medical websites and GitHub repositories with well-documented code. Overall, a combination of generative AI and external resources facilitated the project's progress and development.
